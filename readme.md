AOM Random Maps
===============

Random map scripts for Age of Mythology.

### Installation

Scripts should be installed into the `/rm2/versionX/` directory (where X is your latest version).

### Notes on XS

For those unfamiliar, this is basically C++ but with some mandatory syntax (eg: _for_ loops);

```
// This Works
for(x = 1; < cNumberPlayers)

// This Errors
for(x = 1; x < cNumberPlayers; x ++)
```
