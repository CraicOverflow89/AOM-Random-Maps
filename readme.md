AOM Random Maps
===============

Random map scripts for Age of Mythology.

### Installation

All files in the `src` directory can be copied directly into the game root, other than the language file.

You need to **append** the contents of the `en-language.txt` file **to the existing file** in the `/language/en/` directory.

### Disclaimer

I do not claim to own the rights to Age of Mythology.
