AOM Random Maps
===============

Random map scripts for Age of Mythology.

### Installation

Scripts for any random maps that you want to try (both the `xml` and `xs` files) should be installed into the `/rm2/versionX/` directory (where X is your latest version).

The `cof89_lib.xs` file is a library that is used by all random maps and should also be installed into the same location.

Append the contents of the `en-language.txt` file to the existing file in the `/language/en/` directory.

### Disclaimer

I do not own Age of Mythology.
