45321		"Arkantos: Who are you? "
45322		"Norse Hero: She is Reginleif - a servant of Odin.  She’s trying to stop Ragnarok.  It was she who sent us to track Gargarensis. "

47174		"Krios:  The gods showed me an abandoned Temple in my dreams last night.  I was told it is the key to our leaving this place.  We must find it."

47266		"Kastor: Let's reclaim these Temples and rebuild Atlantis."
47267		"Kastor: What was Zeus doing for us back there? At least Oranos has led us here. If he favors us, we're better offering prayers to him than having none look after us."
47268		"Atlantean Citizen: Attackers!"
47269		"Citizen: Those were Greeks, Krios, why did they attack us?"
47270		"Citizen: Kastor, we have just enough resources to restore the the Temples, after that we'll need to gather more."

47274		"Atlantean Soldier: Kastor, sir, the attacks are coming from a pass that leads to the other side of the island. The Greeks have a base there - we should destroy it."
47275		"Atlantean Citizen: The Greeks are relentless, we really need to build another Town Center so we can keep fighting them off."
47276		"Atlantean Soldier: It sure would be easier to get around if we built some Sky Passages."

Buildings damaged by attacks may be repaired in the same way. When the Temples are repaired, remember to put your Citizens to work gathering the resources you will need to build buildings and train units."
47306		"There are a few things to keep in mind while expanding your town and advancing to the Classical Age. First, the Greeks will keep sending attacks - you will need to train an army to fight them. Second, there is an unclaimed Settlement nearby which Oranos reveals to you on the mini-map; claiming it will give you a stronger foothold on the island and more Population slots. Also, there are overgrown Temples like the ones in your starting town scattered all over the island. When you find these Temples and restore them you will receive free myth units!"
47307		"The Greeks will be defending the pass fiercely. Destroyers are the best choice for demolishing the buildings in the pass. Destroyers may be trained in the Heroic Age from the Palace. Be sure to look at the pass from time to time; you have line of sight to it and can see what the Greeks are training. This will allow you to better prepare your defenses and select which units to train for battle."

You may want to build a Sky Passage near the Greek City so that you can get your armies into battle quickly.

47953		"You are Victorious!"
47954		"Kastor:  It is said that in Olympus the rules are different - a man's form can change as he walks."
47955		"Kastor:  I gave orders to send reinforcements before we departed Greece - it is imperative that we defend this Olympus Passage so they can reach us."
47956		"Kastor:  These Temples will transform our soldiers into different mythical beasts."
47957		"Kastor:  I'll need different mixes of myth units for the obstacles ahead - their strengths and weaknesses vary."
47958		"Kastor:  Legends claim that no mortal may step upon Mount Olympus.  We'll soon see...."
47959		"Kastor:  The peak of the sacred mountain is protected by the heroes of Olympus - very skilled in fighting mythic units."
47960		"Kastor:  These heroes can crush myth units easily - unless they are heavily outnumbered."
47961		"Kastor:  Protect the Olympus Passage!  It must not be destroyed!"
47962		"Kastor:  If we destroy the buildlings from where these Greek soldiers are trained it will slow them down."
47963		"Kastor:  These Shades are instant death to myth units - but only to myth units...."
47964		"Kastor:  It's done!  A mortal stands upon the peak of Mount Olympus!"
47965		"Krios:  Good timing, Kastor - the troops you sent to teach the Egyptians a lesson just returned."
47966		"Kastor:  And the Greeks in Sikyos?"
47967		"Krios:  Your trick worked. The Norse and Egyptian troops started leaving the city two days ago.  They must have gotten word of your attacks on their undefended homelands."
47968		"Kastor:  Good. We should have no problem with the city now."
47969		"Krios:  One more thing, Kastor - our scouts found another of Lord Oranos' passages nearby.  We think it might lead behind the Greek troops.  I thought you might like to lead the force that attacks through it."
47970		"Kastor:  Indeed. Let's get started."
47971		"Soldier:  Where are we?"
47972		"Kastor:  Well, even Krios knows how to be wrong - this passage has taken us to Mount Olympus!"
47973		"Soldier:  Captain - we cannot return the way we came."
47974		"Kastor:  We must fight our way to the peak of Mount Olympus - there is no other option."
47975		"Soldier:  I can't believe we're on Mount Olympus. How could Krios make a mistake like this?"
47976		"Soldier:  We have been granted two Bolt god powers.  "
47977		"Soldier:  We have gained the Ancestors god power. "

48061		"Ajax:  What was that?"
48062		"Amanra:  We have to get to Kastor.  We can use Rocs to get him out of there."

48069		"Krios:  That is a Titan.  Only the lesser ones can escape Tartarus now, but soon they'll free the others."
48070		"Kastor:  I don't understand...."
48071		"Krios:  The power of the Olympian gods was the only thing keeping the Titans imprisoned.  Fortunately, you went around destroying their Temples and killing their followers.  Now the Olympians can no longer hold them."
48072		"Kastor:  Why would you do this?!"
48073		"Krios:  Oh, I didn't do it Kastor.  You did."
48074		"Ajax:  Look - Kastor.  But those are Atlanteans attacking him...."

48158		"Ajax:  Arkantos!"
48159		"Arkantos:  Kastor, the places where you had the Atlanteans build Temples to Oranos allowed Titans to emerge."
48160		"Kastor:  Father... I didn't know…  I was trying to do what was best for Atlantis."

48162		"Kastor:  Fight them?  How can we fight them?"
48163		"Arkantos:  These are the lesser ones.  They were sent to destroy the Temples and followers of the Olympians, to weaken them.  If that is allowed, the greater ones can emerge."
48164		"Amanra:  So there is a Titan in Egypt... now?"
48165		"Arkantos:  Yes... and one in the Norselands.  You will have allies in these places."

48265		"Ajax:  This statue thing better swing a mean sword, that's all I have to say."
48266		"Ajax:  We found another stupid camel."
48267		"Amanra:  The Son of Osiris should only re-charge the Guardian, but if we really need him, he can be commanded to fight."

48276		"Kastor:  The Atlanteans of Kronos are attacking our city! Force them back!"
48277		"Ajax:  What are they doing?"
48278		"Amanra:  That is a Priest of Osiris. He is trying to awaken a Guardian."
48279		"Kastor:  A Guardian? To fight the Titan?"
48280		"Amanra:  Yes. We must defend the Priest while he finishes. Some here will have sided with Krios's forces."

48695		"Enter the Sky Passage to the west of your town (it is hovering over the water just past the ramp to the Citadel of Krios). A Sky Passage on the other side of the island will convert to your control and you will be able to use it to transport the troops you train in the south to save the West Atlantean Citizens (Maroon)."
48696		"Another Sky Passage has converted to your control. It will transport you to the stronghold of the North Atlanteans (Light Blue). You do not have to use the Sky Passage, but you will get your army into battle faster if you do. Remember, if you have several Sky Passages, your units may garrison in one and step out of any of the others."
48697		"To reach the Sky Passage you will need to assault the citadel in the center of the map. It is heavily walled and defended, so you will need to train units which are good at destroying buildings - namely Destroyers and Fire Siphons. Both of these units may be trained at the Palace."
